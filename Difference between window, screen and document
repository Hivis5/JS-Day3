window.moveTo() : move the current window
window.resizeTo() : resize the current window

Document

The Document object represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web pageâ€™s content, which is the DOM tree.
When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object. It is the root node of the HTML document. 
The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.

We can find the HTML elements by using the below document object methods:

document.getElementById(id)
document.getElementsByTagName(name) 
document.getElementsByClassName(name) 
element.innerHTML = new html content
document.createElement(element)
